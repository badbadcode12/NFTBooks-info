                            Their interests are tied to NFTBooks. In order not to betray the expectations of this target group because of the beliefs that have supported us from the beginning. The development of deflationary features in the system is indispensable. What we need to do is reduce the circulating supply, not the non-circulating supply (e.g., Burning).<br><br>
                            
                            In addition, the benefit of token holders is 1-2% of the tokens in the transaction which will be divided equally among everyone. So, if you hold the nftbooks token until the reading transaction is processed, everyone can profit a lot from holding it.<br><br>
                            
                            Holding the NFTBooks token early will also be beneficial if you want to become a Lessor, the token price increases in proportion to the fact that you can buy a book at a cheaper price. Because when publishing, the author will calculate the amount of NFTBooks tokens needed to buy a book at the projection price of dollars.</p>

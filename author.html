                            <p class="regular-16 sub-h1-p">If you are an author, or you own the publishing rights of any work, or you are a journalist, anyone with their own work can become an Author in NFTBooks system.<br>
                                “Author starts with the letter A, which is important for the beginning of NFTBooks. For this solution to be balanced, the author must be able to increase his or her value. Only then, they can focus enough to contribute to the community and support the project.” – NFTBooks Whitepaper.</p>

                        <h2 class="bold-linear bold-32">Fixed fee</h2>
                        <p class="regular-16">Authors will receive a publishing fee, from those who want to own his or her book.</p>

                    <div class="author-2-content">
                        <h2 class="bold-linear bold-32">Lessor</h2>
                        <p class="regular-16">This is similar to the Author selling the physical book through a publisher or releasing the book through platforms like Amazon. But there is a difference, instead of the Author paying a commission on every book sold to publishers or platforms, at NFTBooks the author only has to pay a very small, fixed cost for the network that NFTBooks runs on – this is not a cost NFTBooks will charge, because NFTBooks was born to support the publishing industry and is neutral.</p>

                    <div class="author-2-content">
                        <h2 class="bold-linear bold-32">Flexible fee</h2>
                        <p class="regular-16">Like other NFTs, NFTBooks is oriented towards long-term benefits and increasing intellectual value. Therefore, the Author will receive a cost per transaction with the product published by the Author – precisely, the transaction here is mainly that the Lessor opens the function so that the Reader can borrow books, or transfer books between Lessors.</p>

                <p class="regular-16">Like any sector in the economy, without competition, development will be very slow, be left behind, or even disappear.
                    NFTBooks wants Authors to compete without any barriers, all authors being treated fairly in the ecosystem. Like a blank page, everyone will come together to ask questions and discuss why users love reading this book? Why do most book readers don’t read the entirety of books? Basically, it can be noted that, in addition to competition, all Authors also become supporters of each other to be able to work together. Write better and more professionally, which can help people better understand their customers – the readers.</p>
                <p class="regular-16">To make Authors more specialized, we want to improve tools to assess everyone's reading process, this helps professional authors and new authors to better understand their readers, hence making the reading experience even better. Time is finite, creativity and thinking are limitless, but before that infinity is achieved, we need baseline metrics to be able to measure and raise the baseline of the entire community. This is similar to the in-depth knowledge inherited from university level. NFTBooks developers are quite a fan of Google as they have built a design base to share for everyone, those who make UI or materials for UI can refer to: https://material.io/design.</p>
                <p class="regular-16">Currently, we are exploring how to build an assessment tool of how indicators can be reasonable, if you find any ideas useful, please contact us at support@ nftbooks.info. Some of the indicators being discussed are:</p>
                <div class="author-3-ul">
                    <ul style=" padding-left: 40px;">
                        <li class="regular-16">Full content reader index: This index indicates the number of people who have completed reading the entire book. The higher the index, the more successful the work is. But sometimes it can go wrong in some cases.</li>
                        <li class="regular-16">Percentage of content completed index: This index shows where the majority of readers will give up, this helps book owners and other writers to research and find logical errors about the content to Improve their writing skills.</li>
                        <li class="regular-16">Demo and bought index: In addition to reputation, writing citations is also very important for new authors to attract buyers as well as readers to choose their books. We are also planning to develop a feature that hits this point so that potential writers can reach users sooner based on user reviews. This is perhaps a turning point in the digital market.</li>

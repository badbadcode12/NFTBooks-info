NFTBooks' mission is to bring the best support to Authors and Lessors, while at the same time providing the best service and experience for Readers.</p>

This will reduce the reach of NFTbooks to even more readers for language reasons. That's why NFTBooks has an additional audience of translators.<br><br>

                            Imagine each translator helping Lessor create a new circle of profits with readers in the languages the translators work in, and Lessors are those who believe the book has been translated into the language to sell well. So, isn't the one who benefits the most is the Author? If the Author writes a book with the purpose of sharing, he can completely satisfy his purpose because there will be translators to help him spread the content further.<br><br>
                            
                            Moreover, with the feature of NFTBooks, Author will be the active persons in the contract with translators, they will have the first choice about how much commission they will deduct in their contract when publishing for translators. This makes it possible for translators to secure their benefits forever. The fact that each Translator brings such great benefits to the Author, we consider this to be a symbiotic relationship, degree and mutual respect.</p>

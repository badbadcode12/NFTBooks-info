                                Anyone who owns the NFTBooks token, can become a Lessor. It is very simple to become a Lessor, just own a book on the NFTBooks platform, either by purchasing during the author's sale or by transferring from another book owner.</p>

                        <p class="regular-16 p-526">NFTBooks once emphasized that users will not only include crypto literates, but all readers around the world. But the impediment of crypto technology is making it difficult for those who are older or less tech-savvy. We are aiming to have a product that is so simple to use that every person in the world can use at a touch of a button. Mainly focusing on the less tech savvy audience.<br>
                            Just like how TV entered the American population in the mid-twentieth century “No invention entered American homes faster than black-and-white TV sets; by 1955 half of all U.S. homes had one “. Therefore, according to our vision and prediction, banks will soon integrate direct buying or direct swap to decentralized exchanges like Uniswap or Pancakeswap, which will help us bypass quite a few steps to reach the entire world of reading lovers.<br>
                            About the features; we will build a queue model based on the price the Lessor has set for a book. There will be many types of queue arrangements so Readers can choose as desired to be able to read a book at the cheapest or fastest price.<br>
                            In addition, because extending an unfinished book is so important, intelligent queuing will also be discussed further for the best reader experience; keep them uninhibited and wait too long if NFTBooks becomes overcrowded. Because we want users to be able to borrow books instantly and “Cheaper to Cheapest”.</p>
